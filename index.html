                    I am a student learning Full-Stack Development. Besides my interest in coding, I enjoy solving puzzles, playing video games,
                    working on computers, and watching YouTube (possibly too much). Currently, I work for UTMB in Galveston as a Senior Desktop
                    Support Technician. My wife is pursuing her doctorate in Mathematics at the University of Houston. We have a wonderful little
                    Pomeranian named Baby Girl. She is very spoiled and loves to cuddle, especially under blankets.
